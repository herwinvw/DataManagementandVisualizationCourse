    "\n",
    "The majority of users of bike sharing systems rent bikes to commute to work (66% in Paris[1], 75% in Barcelona [2], >50% in North America [4]). Different temporal patterns for shared bike usage between week days and weekends were observed both in Barcelona [2] and in Paris [3]: during week days, peaks of usage were observed during rush hour, which were not seen at weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Casual users predominately rent a bike for Tourism/Sightseeing (84% of casual users interviewed in the San Fransisco Bay area, see [4]).\n",

    " * The number of bikes rented depends differently on hour of the day (hr), wether it is a workingday or holiday/weekend (workingday) for regular users vs registered users\n",
    " * Other factors, such as weather and season affect the number of rented out bikes in a similar manner in the two user types"
